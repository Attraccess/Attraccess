# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a flexible form management system for resource usage tracking. The system allows administrators to create custom forms for different resource usage actions (start, stop, takeover) with a WYSIWYG editor. When forms are configured for a resource, users must complete them before performing the associated action. All form submissions are stored and can be viewed by the submitter and authorized users through the usage history interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a resource administrator, I want to create custom forms for resource usage actions, so that I can ensure proper procedures are followed when users interact with resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an administrator accesses the form builder THEN the system SHALL display a WYSIWYG editor interface
2. WHEN creating a form THEN the system SHALL allow adding input fields of types: boolean, text, select, number, and textarea
3. WHEN adding input fields THEN the system SHALL allow setting field properties including label, required status, and validation rules
4. WHEN arranging form fields THEN the system SHALL support drag-and-drop reordering
5. WHEN editing a form THEN the system SHALL display a real-time preview of the form as it will appear to users
6. WHEN saving a form THEN the system SHALL validate the form structure and store it in the database
7. WHEN a form is saved THEN the system SHALL associate it with a specific resource and action type (start, stop, takeover)

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a resource administrator, I want to optionally assign forms to resources, so that I can control which resources require form completion for specific actions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring a resource THEN the system SHALL allow selecting forms for start, stop, and takeover actions independently
2. WHEN no form is assigned to an action THEN the system SHALL allow the action to proceed without form completion
3. WHEN a form is assigned to an action THEN the system SHALL require form completion before the action can be executed
4. WHEN updating form assignments THEN the system SHALL immediately apply the changes to the resource

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a resource user, I want to complete required forms before performing resource actions, so that I can provide necessary information and follow established procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN clicking a resource action button (start/stop/takeover) AND a form is configured THEN the system SHALL display the form instead of executing the action
2. WHEN viewing a required form THEN the system SHALL display all configured fields with appropriate input types
3. WHEN submitting a form THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields are completed
4. WHEN form validation passes THEN the system SHALL execute the original resource action
5. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display error messages and prevent action execution
6. WHEN a form submission is successful THEN the system SHALL store the submission data with timestamp and user information

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a resource user, I want to view my form submissions, so that I can track what information I've provided for resource usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing usage history THEN the system SHALL display form submission indicators for relevant entries
2. WHEN a usage history entry has an associated form submission THEN the system SHALL display a "View Form" button
3. WHEN clicking "View Form" THEN the system SHALL display the submitted form data in a read-only format
4. WHEN viewing form submissions THEN the system SHALL show submission timestamp and user information

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with appropriate permissions, I want to view form submissions from other users, so that I can audit resource usage procedures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user has usage history viewing permissions THEN the system SHALL allow viewing form submissions from other users
2. WHEN viewing another user's form submission THEN the system SHALL display the same information as available to the submitter
3. WHEN accessing form submissions THEN the system SHALL respect existing permission structures for usage history access
4. IF a user lacks permissions THEN the system SHALL hide form submission viewing options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want form data to be securely stored and retrievable, so that audit trails are maintained for compliance purposes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a form is submitted THEN the system SHALL store the submission in the database with proper data types
2. WHEN storing form submissions THEN the system SHALL include resource ID, action type, user ID, timestamp, and form data
3. WHEN retrieving form submissions THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and proper relationships
4. WHEN form submissions are accessed THEN the system SHALL log access for audit purposes
5. WHEN forms are deleted or modified THEN the system SHALL preserve existing submission data for historical accuracy
