# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature refactors the existing JWT token-based authentication system to use database-stored session tokens with secure HTTP-only cookies as the primary authentication method while maintaining backward compatibility with Authorization header tokens for programmatic access. The current system uses JWT tokens stored in localStorage on the frontend. The new system will generate random session tokens stored in the database, providing full control over sessions and enabling features like active session management, while using secure HTTP-only cookies for web browser authentication and supporting token-based authentication for API clients and scripts.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web application user, I want my authentication to use secure HTTP-only cookies so that my session tokens are protected from XSS attacks and stored securely in the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in via the web interface THEN the system SHALL generate a random session token, store it in the database, and set an HTTP-only, secure, SameSite cookie containing the session token
2. WHEN a user makes authenticated requests via the web interface THEN the system SHALL automatically include the authentication cookie
3. WHEN a user's authentication cookie is present THEN the system SHALL validate the session token against the database and authenticate the user
4. WHEN a user logs out THEN the system SHALL clear the authentication cookie and remove the session token from the database
5. IF the connection is over HTTPS THEN the cookie SHALL have the Secure flag set
6. WHEN setting the authentication cookie THEN the system SHALL set appropriate expiration time matching the database session expiration

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an API client or script developer, I want to continue using Authorization header tokens so that I can programmatically access the API without browser-based authentication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an API request includes an Authorization header with Bearer token THEN the system SHALL authenticate using the token
2. WHEN both cookie and Authorization header are present THEN the system SHALL prioritize the Authorization header
3. WHEN creating a session programmatically THEN the system SHALL return the session token in the response body without setting cookies
4. WHEN the request includes a specific header indicating programmatic access THEN the system SHALL not set authentication cookies
5. WHEN API documentation is accessed THEN it SHALL clearly indicate both authentication methods are supported

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the authentication system to be secure by default so that user sessions are protected against common web vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN authentication cookies are set THEN they SHALL be HTTP-only to prevent JavaScript access
2. WHEN authentication cookies are set THEN they SHALL use SameSite=Strict or SameSite=Lax for CSRF protection
3. WHEN the application runs over HTTPS THEN cookies SHALL have the Secure flag
4. WHEN cookies are set THEN they SHALL have appropriate Path and Domain attributes
5. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the authentication cookie SHALL be automatically cleared
6. WHEN detecting suspicious activity THEN the system SHALL be able to invalidate cookies server-side

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want the authentication system to work seamlessly with the existing React application so that minimal changes are required to the user interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend makes authenticated requests THEN cookies SHALL be automatically included by the browser
2. WHEN a user logs in successfully THEN the frontend SHALL receive confirmation without needing to handle token storage
3. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the frontend SHALL detect the authentication failure and redirect appropriately
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN it SHALL check authentication status without accessing localStorage
5. WHEN logout occurs THEN the frontend SHALL clear any cached user data and redirect to login

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the system, I want the authentication refactor to support both cookie and header-based authentication so that web browsers and API clients can use appropriate authentication methods.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API clients send Authorization headers with session tokens THEN they SHALL be authenticated successfully
2. WHEN the new authentication system is deployed THEN existing JWT sessions SHALL be invalidated and users will need to log in again
3. WHEN both cookie and header authentication are configured THEN the system SHALL handle both simultaneously
4. WHEN testing the new system THEN both authentication methods SHALL be verifiable independently

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my authentication to be protected against session fixation and other session-based attacks so that my account remains secure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN a new session identifier SHALL be generated
2. WHEN a user's role or permissions change THEN the session SHALL be refreshed with new claims
3. WHEN detecting concurrent sessions THEN the system SHALL handle them according to security policy
4. WHEN a session is compromised THEN administrators SHALL be able to revoke specific sessions
5. WHEN session refresh occurs THEN old tokens SHALL be properly invalidated
6. WHEN cookies are renewed THEN they SHALL use new cryptographic values to prevent replay attacks
